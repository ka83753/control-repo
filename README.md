Control-Repo for CD4PE Hands on Lab
===================================

## Why is this needed?

There is a bit of divergence in this control-repo from the SE-Team [Control-Repo](https://github.com/puppetlabs-seteam/control-repo)

There are a few reasons for this: 
1. CD4PE is currently private
2. There are changes in testing and therefore a bit risky to just merge in to the widely used repo.
3. The lab may change rapidly over the next few months

## Where is this HOL you ask?

So glad you did, you can find the lab [here](https://github.com/puppetlabs/pipelines-self-paced/tree/master/cd4pe)
